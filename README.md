GIF-Camera
==========

A simple Processing(.org) tool that allows you to create animated GIFs of yourself using a computers webcam.

___ HOW TO USE ___

Copy the contents of the 'libraries_you_need' folder to your Processing libraries directory. 
This is usually located in Documents->Processing->Libraries.
Ensure that you start (or restart) Processing after these Libraries are placed in the appropriate folder

The program *may* throw a webcam error related to your webcam ratio.
In this case you will have to edit lines 74 and 192 where the comments say 'EDIT THIS' to a resolution that matches your webcam. 

This was tested on Processing 2.0b8.
